# Bitmark Community Projects
Open source projects made by the community and based on or using Bitmark API and tools will be placed here. The intention of this repository is to collect and promote the Bitmark Open Source Community Projects.

# Do you have a cool project based on or using Bitmark?
We really want to know about it and perhaps we can help you a bit with engineering support and ideas, promote it or just send you a cool Bitmark t-shirt and some nice stickers.

# How you can share your project with us?
Send an email to [Open Source Project](mailto:haiching@bitmark.com) sharing your repository address as well as a description about what your project does. You also can open an issue here or even a pull request, <strong>if you need some help to understand our API or any of our tools, please contact us too.</strong>

One of our engineers will check your project, if it is something cool we definitely will reach back to you.

# Here is a list of cool projects, we are looking forward to add yours here too:
